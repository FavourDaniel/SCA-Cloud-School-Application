This repository contains a Python file and Jenkins file for the first assessment exercise given to us at She Code Africa. It it solely for the task completion.

# Jenkins integration with repo

I made use of an EC2 instance which I created in AWS to directly integrate my github repo to the job build ensuring to use a port 8080.

In the integration process, I created a Jenkins API token before configuring the repository.

After that, I created webhooks in my Github repo as well as creating a Github token. To connect my Jenkins server with the webhook, I created an API token to authenticate from Github. Steps for this was clicking on my account, then selecting the configure option.

Proceeded to selecting add new token, chose a name and generated the token.

## Configuring my github repository
I created a Jenkins file with all stages declared for ease in creating the Jenkins pipeline to be triggered with the webhook. To create the webhook, I opened up my github repo and used the setting and added the webhook. Went ahead to generate a GitHub token that would be authenticated from Jenkins.

Going back to my Jenkins server, I configured the GitHub webhook and token. On completion of this process, I created a Jenkins pipeline to test my webhook then ran it manually so that the Jenkins job would be triggered by the webhook then created a new commit in my GitHub repo.
