# Jenkins integration with repo

I made use of an EC2 instance which I created in AWS to directly integrate my github repo to the job build ensuring to use a port 8080.

In the integration process, I created a Jenkins API token before configuring the repository.

After that, I created webhooks in my Github repo as well as creating a Githun token.
